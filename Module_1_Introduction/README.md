## Introduction to Computational Genetics

Before starting the lectures, we need to have your terminal and VScode running, then we can get started with the commmand line


Install your terminal / VSCode and try out these commands:
```
ls
pwd
cd
more
head
tail
less
cat
```

People in Mac may need to install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/index_es) \
Those with Windows, make sure you have the WSL set up

I have found some great free resources to start learning the command line:
- [Tutorial made by Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#1-overview)
- [The Unix Workbench](https://seankross.com/the-unix-workbench/command-line-basics.html)
