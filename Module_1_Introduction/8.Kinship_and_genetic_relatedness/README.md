**Workshop:**

[KING](https://www.kingrelatedness.com) and the R package Kinship2. 

For this tutorial we will be using an example dataset (MEX_pop.bed/MEX_pop.bim/MEX_pop.fam) provided from PRIMUS \
*Jeffrey Staples, Deborah A. Nickerson, and Jennifer E. Below (2013). Utilizing graph theory to select the largest set of unrelated individuals for genetic analysis. Genet Epidemiol 37, 136-41.* \
All the files and scripts are in workshop folder.

For the tutorial you need to use an older version of the software, please download  [KING 2.2.8,](https://www.kingrelatedness.com/history.shtml)\
Current release generates an empty king.kin file


**Homework:** 

Use KING to estimate the relatedness of the MEX_pop genomes and suggest a possible way of merging the 10 individuals into a single pedigree.
Use Kinship2 to plot a plausible pedigree.
