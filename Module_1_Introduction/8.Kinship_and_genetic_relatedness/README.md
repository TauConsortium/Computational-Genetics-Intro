**Workshop:**

[KING](https://www.kingrelatedness.com) and the R package Kinship2. 

For this tutorial we will be using an example dataset (MEX_pop.bed/MEX_pop.bim/MEX_pop.fam) provided from PRIMUS \

All the files and scripts are in workshop folder.

**Homework:** 

Use KING to estimate the relatedness of the MEX_pop genomes and suggest a possible way of merging the 10 individuals into a single pedigree.
Use Kinship2 to plot a plausible pedigree.
