## Workshop

For this kinship tutorial we will need an older version of KING for the MEX_pop files to work. \
Download **KING 2.2.8, May 10, 2022** here: https://www.kingrelatedness.com/history.shtml

The current version of KING generates an empty king.kin file.

Try the following commands:

``king -b <file>.bed --related``

``king -b <file>.bed --build --rplot``

What does each of these commands do? \
How can we use these outputs to infer a large pedigree where all the individuals are represented?

Try to plot a plausible pedigree of this family using kinship2 in R
