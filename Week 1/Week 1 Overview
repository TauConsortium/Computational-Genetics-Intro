The goal for this week are to have your terminal running, understand genomic browsers and familiarize with genomics concepts.

1. Install your terminal and try out these commands:
ls
pwd
cd
more
head
tail
less
cat

People in Mac may need to install Homebrew https://brew.sh/index_es
This youtube tutorial also seems cool https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxuRxtrO2Ag
I recommend you do the tutorial of "Learn Enough Command Line to Be Dangerous_ A tutorial introduction to the Unix command line"

2. Browse the most common Genomic browsers:
