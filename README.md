# Introduction to Computational Genetics

#### Instructor: Juliana Acosta-Uribe acostauribe@ucsb.edu

This is an introductory course intended to explore the overlap between genetics and statistics using computational methods. While providing a foundation in biological genetics, we will explore different tools and programs that will help us manipulate and study large genomic datasets.

The syllabus [spanish](Syllabus-Espanol.pdf)/[english](Syllabus-English.pdf) provides an outline of the course, detailing the topics that will be covered, the software that we will be using and the recomended readings for the week. A great book to partner with the first two mdules of the training is *Human evolutionary genetics: origins, peoples and disease. Jobling, Mark, and Chris Tyler-Smith. Garland Science, 2019.*

This course is an introductory series divided in three modules:
- [Introduction to computational genetics](Module_1_Introduction)
- Population genetics
- Genetic epidemiology

This repository is structures as follows:

It is important that you watch the lecture videos so you can understand the concepts underlying the code.

## Required Software:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)\
If your operating system is Windows, you will need to install the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2) with Ubuntu Linux distribution (default). Here is s tutorial made by [Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install), and here is an istallation tutorial made by [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/wsl-tutorial) on istalling WSL2 in your VSCode.

Down the line we will be installing and using:
- [R](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/r)
- [python](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python#_install-python-and-the-python-extension)
- [PLINK](https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink2/)
- [VCFtools](https://vcftools.github.io/man_latest.html)
- [BCFtools](https://samtools.github.io/bcftools/bcftools.html)
and others
