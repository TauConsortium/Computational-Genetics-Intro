# Introduction to Computational Genetics


### Juliana Acosta-Uribe acostauribe@ucsb.edu

This is an introductory course intended to explore the overlap between genetics and statistics using computational methods. While providing a foundation in biological genetics, we will explore different tools and programs to run and decode genes. The syllabus [spanish](Syllabus-espanol.pdf) provides an outline of the course, detailing the topics that will be covered, the software that we will be using and the recomended readings for the week. 

This course is an introductory series divided in three modules [Introduction to computational genetics](Module_1_Introduction)
**Population genetics**, and **Genetic epidemiology**.

It is important that you watch the lecture videos so you can understand the concepts underlying the code.

## Required Software:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)\
If your operating system is Windows, you will need to install the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2) with Ubuntu Linux distribution (default). Here is s tutorial made by [Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install), and here is an istallation tutorial made by [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/wsl-tutorial) on istalling WSL2 in your VSCode.

Down the line we will be installing and using:
- [R](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/r)
- [python](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python#_install-python-and-the-python-extension)
- [PLINK](https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink2/)
- [VCFtools](https://vcftools.github.io/man_latest.html)
- [BCFtools](https://samtools.github.io/bcftools/bcftools.html)
and others
