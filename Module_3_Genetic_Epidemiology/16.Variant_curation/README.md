- [AlzForum](https://www.alzforum.org/mutations): Repository of variants in genes implicated in Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD). Currently, it includes the three genes associated with autosomal-dominant AD (APP, PSEN1, PSEN2) plus four genes associated with AD through association studies or pathology (APOE, MAPT, SORL1, and TREM2). AlzForum Foundation Inc.

- [Genetic Variant Interpretation Tool](https://www.medschool.umaryland.edu/genetic_variant_interpretation_tool1.html/): This site displays the evidence categories and descriptions from ACMG/AMP guidelines with simple checkboxes for selecting appropriate criteria. The site then assigns the pathogenicity or benign impact based on the selected evidence categories. University of Maryland School of Medicine.
- [GnomAD](https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/): The Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) aggregates and harmonizes both exome and genome sequencing data from a wide variety of large-scale sequencing projects. The v4 data set (GRCh38) provided on this website spans 730,947 exome sequences and 76,215 whole-genome sequences from unrelated individuals, of diverse ancestries, sequenced as part of various disease-specific and population genetic studies.
