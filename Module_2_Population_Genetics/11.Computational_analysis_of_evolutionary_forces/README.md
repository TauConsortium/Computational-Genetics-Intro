**Assignment:**

Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disease caused by a variant* in the CFTR gene (T > C). Carriers of two recessive alleles (CC) present the disease.

You sequenced 215 individuals with the following phenotypes:
    150 Healthy and 65 with Cystic Fibrosis
    The genotypes were: TT=90, TC=60, CC=65

Calculate the expected frequencies of the T (dominant) and C (recessive) alleles, and the expected genotypes (TT, TC and CC) under the HWE.

Is the observed variant outside HWE?
